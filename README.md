# Assembler
Language translator hack to assembler. (Nand to tetris course)

This project is very simple to use, but have the limitation that does not validate syntax errors.
When the project is opened is necessary import a hack code, the dialog window accepts .txt and .asm files. Once the file is import the program begin to translate the hack code to assembler. When the results are finished, the program show you the results and process on its corresponding areas, also shows the final dictionary.

The program have two additional things. It is possible clear all the areas with a click on a icon, and also, It has a comparison area where is posibly import a assembler code and it comparers with the last result on its areas, this returns which lines are the same and which are not. This are was make for import nand2tetris result, for know if the program returns the correct result.

That's all!
